# CodeAmp Circuit

Deployment pipeline from the future!


TODO:
=====

1. Install default extensions depending on project type
2. Create a full separation of environments where project features, releases, extensions and settings will be different depending on the environment context the user is in.
3. Implement CI and any other standard extensions that will be almost certainly be required for project deployments.
4. Implement Access Control to restrict views based on permissioning, either with an external API (e.g. Dex, Okta) or in-house.
5. Implement Audit Trail to view all actions users have made in a particular project (possibly in the form of an extension)
6. Implement a dashboard with relevant graphs and metrics for admins and user-specific deployments.
7. Implement relevant views and metrics for the environments manager.
8. Map branches to specific environments (either on a project or global basis)
9. Documentation on creating an Extension and guided walkthrough
